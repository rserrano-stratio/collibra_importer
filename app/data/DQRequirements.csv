A Data Quality Scorecard based on a number of ï¿½business rulesï¿½ applied to atomic data (policy & claims) allows us to build up a picture, on a field by field basis, of how good the quality of the data is and how well the supporting systems are functioning. Sites should have process in place that allows data quality rules to be run against Policy and Claims data and a Scorecard to present the results in a meaningful way. Rules should be transparent and maintainable.",47796d81-1fec-4df3-96ea-54dbaaa2ee8a,TRUE,,DD101598,Fri Feb 19 05:31:51 HKT 2021

Models and processes that take atomic data items and derive new data items are common within Insurance. This presents a challenge when the model outputs are different in nature (i.e. not directly comparable) to the inputs. Bespoke model controls should be in place to mitigate this model & process risk. Analysis of Change should be performed for material models to demonstrate that results are reasonable (e.g. analysis of change in Economic Capital from one period to the next).Where ï¿½model pointsï¿½ are derived from atomic policy data, sites should periodically demonstrate that the financial results obtained using the model points is not materially different to those obtained using the un-grouped data.",47796d81-1fec-4df3-96ea-54dbaaa2ee8a,TRUE,,DD101599,Fri Feb 19 05:31:51 HKT 2021

Models and processes that take atomic data items and derive new data items are common within Insurance. This presents a challenge when the model outputs are different in nature (i.e. not directly comparable) to the inputs. Bespoke model controls should be in place to mitigate this model & process risk. Analysis of Change should be performed for material models to demonstrate that results are reasonable (e.g. analysis of change in Economic Capital from one period to the next).Where ï¿½model pointsï¿½ are derived from atomic policy data, sites should periodically demonstrate that the financial results obtained using the model points is not materially different to those obtained using the un-grouped data.",47796d81-1fec-4df3-96ea-54dbaaa2ee8a,TRUE,,,Fri Feb 19 05:31:51 HKT 2021
